// when to use let and when to use const

const playerName = "Per"
let credits = 45

//const - cant be reassigned
// If possible, use const. If not, use let.

// Which variables below should be changed from let to const?

// The customer wants to order some stuff. Here are the details:
const basePrice = 520
const discount = 120
let shippingCost = 12
let shippingTime = "5-12 days"

// Whops! Turns out the shipping will be a bit more complex
shippingCost = 15
shippingTime = "7-14 days"

// Calculating the full price
const fullPrice = basePrice - discount + shippingCost

// Finally, notifying the customer
console.log("Total cost: " + fullPrice + ". It will arrive in " + shippingTime)






// SETTING THE STAGE
const player = "Per"
const opponent = "Nick"
const game = "AmazingFighter"
let points = 0
let hasWon = false

// PLAYING THE GAME
points += 100
hasWon = true

// ANNOUNCING THE WINNER
if (hasWon) {
    console.log(`${player} got ${points} points and won the ${game} game!`)
} else {
    console.log(`The winner is  ${opponent} ! ${player} lost the game`)
}

// Go through all variables and decide if they should be let or const
// Change the console logs to use template strings instead of double quotes

// Count to ten!

// We need to specify...

// Where should we START counting?
// Where is the FINISH line?
// What's the STEP SIZE we should use?

//    START           FINISH       STEP SIZE
for (let i = 20; i < 21  ; i += 1){

// Create a for loop that counts from 10 to 100 in steps of 10
// Use console.log to log out the numbers
 for (let i = 10; i < 101 ; i += 10){

// you can use the same variable in two different loops eg the fist loop i variable
// is the same as the second loop i variable its because the {} are scope based.

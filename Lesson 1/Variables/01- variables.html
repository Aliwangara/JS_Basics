        // The second variable we are going to learn is the const variable
         //const cant be reassigned eg.
            const variable = 3;

            //variable = 4; - This will throw an error because const variables cannot be reassigned
            console.log(variable); // 3

        // The third variable we are going to learn is the var variable

        var variable3 = 3; // we dont use this variable anymore

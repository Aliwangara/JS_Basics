        // The boolean data type can only have two values: true or false
        // Types of comparison operators in boolean include: >- greater than, Less than-<, >= - greater than or equals to ,less than or equals to- <=,equals to- ===, !== - not equals to

        //eg:
        console.log(5 > 3); // true
        console.log(5 < 3); // false
        console.log(5 >= 3); // true
        console.log(5 <= 3); // false
        console.log(5 === 3); // false
        console.log(5 !== 3); // true
     
        //Booleans have lower priority than math operators
        //eg:
        console.log(5 + 3 > 7); // true - it calculates 5 + 3 first the checks if the result is greater than 7
        console.log(5 + 3 < 7); // false - it calculates 5 + 3 first the checks if the result is less than 7
